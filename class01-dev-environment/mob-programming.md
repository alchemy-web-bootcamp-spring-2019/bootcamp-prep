**Prep**

Install Mobster on your machine: http://mobster.cc/. Click the download button at the top. If you have windows or linux, click the "other platforms" link below it.


**What**

Mob Programming is an intensive team-based programming practice. Think of the bridge of a starship, or the cockpit of an airplane, or an operating room. All the skills needed to do the work are present in one space. The "rules" of mob programming (that will become flexible *once you master the practice*) are:

1. **the Driver**: ideas must go through someone else's hands into the keyboard. In mobbing, this is called the **Driver**. Their job is simple; implement the ideas of the mob (through the Navigator), even if they disagree.

1. **the Navigator**: All the mob's ideas are filtered by one person, the **Navigator**, who is a kind of traffic cop for keeping the Driver from getting instructions yelled at them from every direction. The Navigator has final say on what the Driver will implement; their job is to suss out the will of the mob around them and pass that on as instruction to the Driver.

1. **Timed Rotations**: Mob member roles shift in timed rotations. Every 3 minutes roles rotate, the Driver becomes Navigator, the Navigator becomes a mobber, and a mobber becomes a Driver. Every 25 or 30 minutes the team stops for a retrospective and a break.

1. **Brief Retrospectives**: In a brief 1-5 minute retrospective, the mob asks itself what they noticed about their Tools, Environment, Interactions, and Resources. Out of those observations, is there anything they can improve with a simple change?

1. **Break**: Industry-wide, the most recognized problem-solving and software-debugging tool is a break, free of electronics or screens, such as a drink of water, a short walk, or a refreshing chat.

**Why**

Mob programming is a cutting-edge software development practice; therefore you may or may not find work at a company that uses mob programming. 

However due to the problems that mob programming solves in terms of elevated software quality, improved safety, elimination of bugs, accelerated learning, reduction of waste through rework, meetings, and handoffs, it has become a core practice at Alchemy in both our student cohorts and our App Lab consultancy. Learning to mob program is part of your tech leadership journey.

Mobbing is a skill! Use your time in the mobs well and work to become a better Driver, Navigator, and Mobber.
